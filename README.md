# hello-world
An introductory project

Here is a paragraph of information that ostensibly is all about me, but here I am on a world stage:  I'm not comfortable
writing at great length about me in such a situation, so I will not do so.

Inserted a line here on May 28, 2022.

Extra Ideas
-----------

It's not impossible to add additional information later, in a separate branch, so as not to interfere with
the master branch.

Even More New Ideas
-------------------

Why don't we add and commit another bunch of information?
